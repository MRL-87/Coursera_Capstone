    "There is a huge amount of factors to be taken into consideration when developing a business plan aimed to create a new fast food industry reality to an already overcrowded country as America. Besides economical, sociological and legal aspect, one of the most important aspects to be decided by the stakeholders is the geographical location of the future business. I, as a data scientist, will try to answer the question \"Which is the most favorable within the Brooklyn area (neighborhood) for a new fast food chain to be initiated?\" i will guide you a journey which main objective is to answer the mentioned question and analyzing the tools involved in this process. Thank you in advance for reading!"

For these reasons, i have chosen the Rugby and Remsen village as the most feasible choices.\n",
